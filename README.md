# I love Ruby!
### And this repository is meant to be a vault of the small and study projects I am doing during my learning path

## Current projects in this repo:
### Temperature Conversor
#### In the terminal, on the same folder, type ```ruby temperature-conversor.rb```, pick a choice between Celcius and Fahrenheit and it will convert each to other.

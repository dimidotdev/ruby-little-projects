# I love Ruby!
### And this repository is meant to be a vault of the small and study projects I am doing during my learning path
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current projects in this repo:

### Temperature Conversor
#### In the terminal, on the same folder, type ```ruby temperature-conversor.rb```, pick a choice between Celcius and Fahrenheit and it will convert each to other.

### Guessing Game
#### In the terminal, on the same folder, type ```ruby guessing-game.rb```, and try to guess the number. The program will run until you guess the chosen secret number. Tip: use the binary search concept to lower your tries. For example, pick the number in the middle, in this case 50. The game will inform if is lower or higher, if is higher, the number in the middle will be 75. And there we go, you will always discard 50% of the remaining, and you will use less tries to find the number.
